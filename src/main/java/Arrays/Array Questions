Here are some basic array-related questions suitable for a **Test Automation Engineer** to practice:

1. **Reverse an Array**
   Write a program to reverse an array of integers.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
   Output: `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

---

2. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Element in an Array**
   Write a program to find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{4, 1, 9, 2, 7}`
   Output:
   Maximum: `9`
   Minimum: `1`

---

3. **Check if an Array Contains a Specific Value**
   Write a program to check if a given integer exists in an array.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`, search for `30`
   Output: `Yes, it is present.`

---

4. **Find Duplicate Elements in an Array**
   Write a program to find duplicates in an array.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1}`
   Output: `1 and 2 are duplicates.`

---

5. **Find the Sum of All Elements in an Array**
   Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{5, 10, 15, 20}`
   Output: `50`

---

6. **Find the First Repeated Element**
   Write a program to find the first element that repeats in the array.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3}`
   Output: `5`

---

7. **Rotate an Array to the Left by a Given Number of Steps**
   Write a program to rotate the elements of an array to the left.
   **Example:**
   Input: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, rotate by 2
   Output: `{3, 4, 5, 1, 2}`

These problems will help in practicing logical thinking, handling edge cases, and writing efficient test scenarios that are common for test automation roles. Let me know if you need solutions to any of these!
